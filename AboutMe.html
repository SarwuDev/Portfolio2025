        <p class="plus-jakarta-sans">Graduating in May, 2025, will mark eight years of video production practice and education, granting me a degree in graphic/visual design and two minors (Motion Design and Film Production). My first year of university saw the continuance of clever design and unique motion graphics experience as I quickly became a go-to motion and graphic designer for many. I made myself constantly available for any opportunity to contribute to my university's sports, concert, and event productions. My Bēhance page shows the full extent of these projects. I consistently exceeded expectations in all positions, often expanding the original scope of the project. I have been a reliable editor for multiple content creators, often building multi-year professional relationships through timeliness and high-quality deliverables.</p>
        <p class="plus-jakarta-sans">My video editing skills have been in use since I bought my first laptop: beginning as a freelance video editor led me to over seven years of experience in video editing roles, most recently with Neuemotion as a Video Production Intern. Collaborating with their creative team, I worked on projects for F1, Salesforce, and Impulse Labs, to name a few. Aside from this experience, I also became a dependable teacher’s assistant for post production courses and willingly offered help to peers struggling to create motion graphics for their own courses. </p>
